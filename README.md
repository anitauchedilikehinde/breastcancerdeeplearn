Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer among women and a large amount of time is dedicated to diagnosing this disease. The process of diagnosing breast cancer is also prone to errors and misdiagnosis hence an automated approach to image detection and classification is crucial to reduce delayed or missed diagnosis, and the workload for pathologists. This report presented an exploration of breast cancer histopathology images and proposed a Convolutional Neural Network model for predicting breast cancer. The proposed model achieved an 83% accuracy on training data and 81% accuracy on testing data and outperformed other deeper CNN models built, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest models. Image augmentation was also utilized to increase amount of the training data because of overfitting.
